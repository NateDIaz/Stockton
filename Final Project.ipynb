    "\n",
    "#We decided to use the FIFA World Cup Matches dataset in order to predict the winner of the 2018 World Cup.\n",
    "#Predicting this variable is relevant because we want to see if there are criteria that needs to be fulfill in order to see a team winning the world cup of if it is completely random. \n",
    "#The dataset used in this paper comes from the FIFA World Cup Archive website. The target variable(stage) is a categorical variable describing the stage at which a team is playing a game.\n",
    "#The original dataset consists of 4573 observations across 21 variables breaking down the information of each contest played in the FIFA World Cup. The dataset includes input variables such as: “year”, which is the year in which the match was played; “Datetime”, which is the exact date the match was played, “Stage”, which is the phase in which the match was played, ‘Attendance’, which is the number of people in the stadium during the match, as well as many others. A full list and description of the variables in the dataset is in appendix A.\n",
    "#Eight of the 21 variables have been removed from the dataset. Among them, there are:”RoundID”,”MatchID”,”Referee”,”Assistant.1”,”Assistant.2”,”Datetime”,Home.Team.Initials”, “Away.Team.Initials.” Datetime, Home.Team.Initials, “Away.Team.Initials” have been removed because they provide the same information as  other columns such as Year or ”Home.Team.Name” .  “RoundID”, “MatchID”,” Referee”,”Assistant.1”,” Assistant.2” have been removed because they are not useful for the purpose of this paper.\n",
    "#The categorical variable “Stage” had 24 levels in the first place, but it was then reduced to 5 in order to have a better accuracy of the models.\n",
